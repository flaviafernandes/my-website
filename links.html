            <li>Case Customer Centric | Design artefacts 
                Design artefacts:
                - artefacts used within innovation and design processes, and any visual objects towards which and with which individuals act.
                - artefacts that have been created during the design process, such as: prototypes, journey maps and wire frames 
                - artefacts that constitute a final product or service are nor design artefacts!

                This case study highlights the potential of design artefacts to support organizational change
